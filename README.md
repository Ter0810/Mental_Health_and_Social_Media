# Mental Health and Social Media Usage Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report presents findings from an analysis of the Mental Health and Social Media Balance Dataset, examining the relationship between social media usage patterns and mental health outcomes. Our analysis reveals significant correlations between digital habits and mental well-being, with machine learning models successfully predicting stress levels based on behavioral factors.

## Key Findings

### 1. How Social Media Usage Patterns Affect Mental Health
- **Screen Time Impact**: Users with >6.7 hours of daily screen time showed stress levels of 8.0/10 (32% higher than average)
- **Social Media Dependency**: High dependency users showed stress levels of 6.7/10
- **Digital Balance**: Screen-to-exercise ratio emerged as a critical factor

### 2. Behavioral Factors That Predict Mental Health Outcomes
**Strongest Predictors of Stress:**
1. Screen-to-Exercise Ratio (Importance: 0.82)
2. Daily Screen Time (Importance: 0.08)
3. Social Media Dependency (Importance: 0.02)
4. Exercise Frequency (Importance: 0.02)

**Impact of Exercise:**
- Users exercising <1.0 times/week showed stress levels of 6.2/10

### 3. Machine Learning Model Performance
**Predictive Accuracy:**
- **Random Forest (Optimized)**: R� = 0.8873
- **Linear Regression**: R� = 1.0000
- **Ridge Regression**: R� = 0.9999

## Recommendations

### Targeted Interventions
1. **Screen Time Management**: Implement daily limits of <4 hours for optimal mental health
2. **Exercise Promotion**: Recommend 3+ exercise sessions per week
3. **Social Media Dependency Reduction**: Promote "digital detox" periods of 2+ days per week

### Digital Wellness Tools
1. **Risk Assessment Calculator**: Based on key behavioral factors
2. **Balanced Lifestyle Dashboard**: Visualizing screen time vs. exercise
3. **Intelligent Notifications**: For breaks and alternative activities

### Awareness Programs
1. **Educational Content**: About screen time and mental health relationship
2. **Workplace Wellness Programs**: "Digital wellness" challenges
3. **School Programs**: Digital literacy and mental health curriculum

## Conclusion
Our analysis demonstrates a clear relationship between social media usage patterns and mental health outcomes. By focusing on creating balance between digital and physical activities, organizations and mental health practitioners can help mitigate the negative impacts of social media on mental well-being.
